Interview questions to ponder related to computer vision.

## Imaging Systems

* rough overview of a camera calibration process
* say you have acquired a number of constraints for example during camera calibration process - how do you solve the system of the constraints (e.g. describe gradient method in 3-4 sentences)
* Describe the sources of noise in an image sensor.
* How does a camera see in color?
* Draw the schematic of a 3T pixel architecture.
* List out all of the lens parameters you can think of.
* You've got a camera that powers on and takes pictures, but the images it captures are very dim. What could be the potential problems?
* What are the typical voltage levels required to operate an image sensor? What power domains do these voltages supply to?
* Your image is blurry. What are the potential issues?
* Explain fixed pattern noise (FPN). Where does it come from? How do you correct for FPN?
* How do you configure an image sensor?
* How does data get out of an image sensor? What are some standards you know of?
* Suppose you have a flash LED that can deliver a high lumen output for a fraction of a second, but no more. How would you synchronize the LED with the start of a frame?

## Mathematics
* what are eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## 3D Image Processing
* what is the camera matrix and what does it consist of
* how to convert the point for 3D world coordinates into 2d image coordinates

## 2D Image Processing
* rough overview of optical flow estimation (again, just 3-4 sentences)
* what are the necessary assumptions during optical flow estimation (answer: constant image brightness, no lens/shutter distortion)

## Detection
* what visual features do I know (SIFT, SURF, ORB, etc)
* how does the detector of the feature X work
