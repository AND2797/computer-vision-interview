# computer-vision-interview
Interview questions to ponder related to computer vision.

##Imaging Systems

* rough overview of a camera calibration process
* say you have acquired a number of constraints for example during camera calibration process - how do you solve the system of the constraints (e.g. describe gradient method in 3-4 sentences)

## Mathematics
* what are eigenvalues and eigenvectors

## 3D Image Processing
* what is the camera matrix and what does it consist of
* how to convert the point for 3D world coordinates into 2d image coordinates

## 2D Image Processing
* rough overview of optical flow estimation (again, just 3-4 sentences)
* what are the necessary assumptions during optical flow estimation (answer: constant image brightness, no lens/shutter distortion)

## Detection
* what visual features do I know (SIFT, SURF, ORB, etc)
* how does the detector of the feature X work
